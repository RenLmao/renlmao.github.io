            <h1>Modeled Engine</h1>
            <p class="description">
                This is a small assignment in which, in Autodesk Inventor, I have prepared an engine model. <br>
                The emphasis was on a workable crankcase design. <br>
                I used the software's parametric tools to model the crankcase to accommodate the engine components correctly for proper interaction and motion. <br>
                It included essential features such as oil ways and mounting points for the cylinders. <br>
                The project helped me in acquiring practical experience in 3D CAD modeling, precision engineering, and fundamentals of engine design. <br>
                Though it was a small task, it provided a very great insight into mechanical systems and how the different design principles can be applied to real-life situations.
