                This project is the culmination of months of reverse engineering and deep analysis of the Steam VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) system. The primary focus was on uncovering the intricacies of how VAC detects and prevents cheats, particularly in games like CS:GO. By decrypting the ICE keys and fully reversing their CS:GO-specific VAC module, I was able to understand the logic behind its operations. This required working with low-level system calls, memory mapping, and dynamic analysis tools.
                <br><br>
                Throughout the project, I utilized tools such as IDA Pro (cracked, duh), Ghidra (cracked, duh), and custom-built debugging scripts to dissect the VAC's inner workings. One key breakthrough was successfully bypassing integrity checks embedded in the anti-cheat system, which involved crafting a set of countermeasures that could evade detection while maintaining system stability.

                While anticheats like VAC are inherently complex and evolving, the info gained during this project introduced me as to how these systems function at their core. For those unfamiliar with anticheat technologies, I highly recommend exploring the field�it�s a fascinating blend of software security, cryptography, and real-time analysis.
