                The project is based on the result of a database breach of Rockstar Games Inc. <br>
                From analyzing and piecing together the fragments from the breach, I was able to reconstruct parts of the game's code and assets. <br>
                I aimed at creating the first playable version of GTA IV from the extracted materials. <br>
                While the project is a fun exploration of how incomplete game files can be reworked, it also serves as a reminder of the importance of securing sensitive data. <br>
                This was an educational project for learning and not created for commercial use.
