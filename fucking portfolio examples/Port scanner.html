                This project was a relatively small yet interesting endeavor, created primarily to explore the functionality and mechanics of network security. It is a Wi-Fi Port Scanner that identifies all open ports within a network and provides an analysis of potential exploits based on data from trusted sources like CISA and Exploit-DB.
                <br><br>
                The tool was developed entirely in Python, showcasing its capabilities for network analysis and vulnerability detection. The project, though completed in just 3 weeks, offered significant learning opportunities in network scanning, exploit detection, and leveraging external security databases for real-time analysis.
