            <p class="description">This project was relatively small and mostly just to pass time. It is a Wifi Port Scanner that checks every open port and makes an analysis as to which exploits could be used on them, this used infomation from: CISA and Exploit-Db. This was made only using python, and took 3 weeks to make.</p>
