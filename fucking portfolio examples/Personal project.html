                This project was one of my biggest projects, designed to create a dynamic and interactive website graphing tool. The main goal was to visualize websites as interconnected nodes in a 3D tree structure. The tool utilized Unity for its graphical rendering capabilities and HTMLAgilityPack for parsing and processing website data.
                <br><br>
                At its core, the project was a deep dive into graphing theory, combining concepts like node-based representation, hierarchical relationships, and dynamic physics simulations. One of the major challenges was implementing a semi-realistic physics engine to organize everything. The engine ensured that non-cyclical links repelled one another to prevent clutter while cyclical links naturally gravitated together to emphasize their relationships.
                <br><br>
                Beyond graphing, the project introduced features such as hover-based interaction, where users could inspect node information, and real-time scanning capabilities, allowing them to explore the structure of any webpage starting from a root node. Debugging and optimizing the engine for performance across a wide range of input sizes a demanding aspect of the project.
                <br><br>
                This experience not only refined my skills in Unity and C# but also broadened my understanding of web technologies and graph visualization.
