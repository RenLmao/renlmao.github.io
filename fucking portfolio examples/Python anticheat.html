                This project served as an exploration into the mechanics and principles behind modern anticheats. The goal was to design a modular anticheat system that could theoretically be plug-and-play for a variety of applications. The system featured several key modules, including memory scanning, loaded DLL checks, network connection monitoring, and file tampering detection.
                <br><br>
                The majority of the project was implemented in Python (90%), with some supplementary modules written in C# (10%) for tasks requiring lower-level operations or integration. Through this process, I gained hands-on experience in fundamental anticheat techniques and developed a deeper understanding of Steam's VAC system, which I later reversed for further learning.
                <br><br>
                While primarily a personal project to enhance my knowledge, this anticheat system also helped refine my skills in process memory analysis, network monitoring, and secure programming practices. The project spanned four months and provided valuable insights into both Python and C# capabilities in security-related applications.
