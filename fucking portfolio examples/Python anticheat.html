            <p class="description">This project was mostly an attempt at trying to understand what anticheats do and how they work. I made a module based anticheat that would theorectically be plug and play in terms of usage. I created multiple modules that would: scan memory, checked loaded dlls, monitor the network connections, stop file tampering and etc. These were 90% python, 10% C# and helped me with understanding the basics of how the Steam VAC Anticheat works, which I then reversed. This was a simple project to pass time, it took around 4 months. </p>
