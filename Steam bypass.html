                This project builds upon the foundational work of the Steam VAC Reversal initiative. The primary objective was to entirely block the tool's access to Steam's backend servers and the local system, effectively rendering VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) unable to perform its intended functions. Throughout the project, several challenges were tackled, such as reverse-engineering Steam's network protocols, crafting robust bypass methods, and ensuring long-term reliability against potential updates.
                <br><br>
                One notable milestone was achieving complete stealth mode integration, which allowed the tool to bypass Steam's security checks without raising any alarms. Rigorous testing was conducted across various systems to ensure consistency and to preemptively identify and patch any vulnerabilities in the approach. The process was highly iterative, requiring constant adjustments and validation.
                <br><br>
                Development took approximately five months, during which extensive research into system-level permissions, memory editing techniques, and encrypted communication intercepts was conducted. Steam's apparent lack of updates to their anticheat infrastructure played a significant role in the tool's success, highlighting the outdated nature of the current protection systems. As of the end of the development phase, the bypass remained fully functional, a testament to the thorough and strategic approach taken by the team.
