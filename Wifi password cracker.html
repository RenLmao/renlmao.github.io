            <p class="description">This mini-project was done for fun and is showcasing a simple C# application that is able to brute-force Wi-Fi passwords. <br> It uses some libraries like System.Net and System.Security.Cryptography in an attempt to brute-force various weak passwords. <br> This application uses either a pre-constructed combination list or generates random combinations in an attempt to crack WEP and WPA-secured networks. <br> It's visualized in a simple console, which shows the progress as each password is tried. <br> Although this project does not have any practical implementation and does not interfere with real networks, it outlines simple network vulnerabilities and reminds one to protect Wi-Fi passwords as treasured.</p>
